    <string name="welcome_slide1_desc">Writing down your goals is a helpful way of visualising them and begin to make them a reality. Hopefully this simple app will help you realise your goals, big or small.</string>
    <string name="welcome_slide2_desc">So, you have an idea for a goal.\n Is it SMART? \nSpecific\nMeasurable\nAttainable\nRelevant\nTimely.</string>
    <string name="welcome_slide3_desc">Reciting your goals on a regular basis will help to keep you focused in achieving them.\nIt is common to recite your goals once per day, in the evening before bed or first thing in the morning.</string>
    <string name="welcome_slide4_desc">We deliberately hide your previously entered goals until you make a new entry. This forces you to think about what you want to achieve each time you visit.</string>
    <string name="welcome_slide5_desc">The goals you enter are stored privately on your personal device.</string>
    <string name="welcome_slide6_desc">You don\'t have to set a goal that will change the world, but it does have to be something that you think will improve your life in either a social, financial, professional or educational way. \nE.g. Loose 10lbs this month.</string>
