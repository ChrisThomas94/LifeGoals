# LifeGoals

The purpose of LifeGoals is to encourage the user to spend 5 minutes each and every day to recite their 10-15 life goals.

Reciting goals, typically using pen and paper, has been observed to increase the liklihood of an individual achieving that goal or a set of goals.

Personally i have found writing my goals down onto a piece of paper to be highly inconvenient for a number of reasons.
1) I do not always have pen and paper at hand, especially when i am in bed (just before sleep) which is the most likely time of day for me to partake in reciting my goals.
2) Ones goals should be kept somewhat of a secret from others, scraps of paper and journals do not appeal to me as secure mediums as much as my smartphone. Sure maybe the Chinese government will find out my goals but at least they will be kept secret from those who i come into close contact with.
3) I am tempted to peek at the goals i wrote down previously on a different page of my journal. The value of reciting goals doesn't so much lie in the repetition of the goals as if writing lines in detention at school, but rather the process of thinking to ones self what they want to achieve.

The app therefore addresses each of the above points.
1) Digital
2) Locally stored data with password protection
3) Previous goals are not displayed until a new set of goals have been entered
