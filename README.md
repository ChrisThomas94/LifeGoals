# LifeGoals

The purpose of LifeGoals is to encourage the user to spend 5 minutes each and every day to recite their 10-15 life entry.

Reciting entry, typically using pen and paper, has been observed to increase the liklihood of an individual achieving that goal or a set of entry.

Personally i have found writing my entry down onto a piece of paper to be highly inconvenient for a number of reasons.
1) I do not always have pen and paper at hand, especially when i am in bed (just before sleep) which is the most likely time of day for me to partake in reciting my entry.
2) Ones entry should be kept somewhat of a secret from others, scraps of paper and journals do not appeal to me as secure mediums as much as my smartphone. Sure maybe the Chinese government will find out my entry but at least they will be kept secret from those who i come into close contact with.
3) I am tempted to peek at the entry i wrote down previously on a different page of my journal. The value of reciting entry doesn't so much lie in the repetition of the entry as if writing lines in detention at school, but rather the process of thinking to ones self what they want to achieve.

The app therefore addresses each of the above points.
1) Digital
2) Locally stored data with password protection
3) Previous entry are not displayed until a new set of entry have been entered
